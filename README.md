## Description
Made this to help out with tracking coop/job positions. Could have used spreadsheet/notepad/text but something about a dedicated tool to specifically track what i'm looking for makes it easier to manage. The tradeoff to build this as opposed to using something like the tools i've mentioned was well worth it... This app is just a cli app that uses leveldb to store documents/records. Hopefully in the future I can integrate some AI into it to perform more complex tasks.


## Usage
Will provide more thorough help, but when you install this cli tool globally just use `CoopHelp` to see options
